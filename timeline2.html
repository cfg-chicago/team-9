      <p>Today, each and every Lawndale Elementary Community Academy student was blessed with a backpack full of school supplies! We are so grateful to our partners Cradles to Crayons Chicago for preparing our Lawndale students for success! Did we mention each bag includes a thoughtful note?! :) #TogetherWeWin</p>

      <p>This past weekend our almost 7th grade #PitchIn students went on our first overnight trip with Chicago Voyagers! We had an absolute blast camping, canoeing, hiking and learning how to cook over the campfire! Our camp leader, Bess, led us on an incredible journey through team challenges, nature trails, waterways and taught us how to be responsible campers! </p>
